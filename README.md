# The Locker Room

A web application built with the combination of HTML, Django, and CSS, The Locker Room is an example of a standard internet messaging board with a sports motif. New users can sign in and gain access to the ability to create new topics, edit their posts, and reply to others. Authorization is in place, as unauthenticated users can only read topics and posts. Other features of The Locker Room include custom styling using Bootstrap as well as standard CSS to create stylized table elements and a responsive navbar component.  

More features are being planned, including: the ability to upload custom avatar icons, the ability to delete posts, and additional page styling.
